    Artisans in Indonesia hand-pick each piece of teak wood to create this soap dish, so every piece has no parallel. Apart from being easy to work with, they chose this kind of wood for its strength and high oil content, which make it mold-resistant. To finish it off, they coated this soap dish with beeswax and natural oil, making it longer-lasting and emphasizing teak wood's beauty.

    With generous drainage holes at the center, this soap dish ensures no soggy bar of soap again. It's specially carved with a slight contour to cradle your soap, shampoo bar, or even kitchen sponge.
